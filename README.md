# Kaya.js

A fast and lightweight Spellscript interpreter written in pure JavaScript.

## Spellscript

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="media/exampleImg.png" alt="Description of the image" style="width: 100%;">
</div>

_Spellscript_ is a procedural, library-dependent, interpreted programming language made by [JTnadrooi](). It's very lightweight and designed for simple linear tasks.

<sub>_From now on, I will use the "Can I code a spell interpreter in it?" benchmark to decide if I know a language or not._</sub>
